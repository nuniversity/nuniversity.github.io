# Getting Started with Programming

Welcome to your first programming lesson! ðŸŽ‰

## What is Programming?

Programming is the process of creating instructions for computers to follow. Think of it as teaching a computer how to solve problems or perform tasks.

## Why Learn Programming?

- **Problem Solving**: Develop logical thinking skills
- **Career Opportunities**: High demand for programmers
- **Creativity**: Build your own applications and tools
- **Automation**: Save time by automating repetitive tasks

> [!NOTE]
> Programming is like learning a new language. It takes practice, but anyone can learn it!

## Key Concepts

In this course, you'll learn:

1. Variables and data types
2. Functions and methods
3. Control flow (if/else, loops)
4. Data structures
5. Problem-solving strategies

## Your First Program

Let's start with the classic "Hello, World!" program:

\`\`\`javascript
// This is a comment
console.log("Hello, World!");
\`\`\`

This simple program displays a message to the screen. Don't worry if you don't understand everything yet!

> [!SUCCESS]
> Congratulations! You've started your programming journey!

## Practice Exercise

Try modifying the code above to print your own name:

\`\`\`javascript
console.log("Hello, [Your Name]!");
\`\`\`

## Next Steps

In the next lesson, we'll dive into variables and learn how to store and manipulate data.
