# Eisenhower Matrix Tool

Master time management with the Eisenhower Matrix, also known as the Urgent-Important Matrix. This powerful productivity tool helps you prioritize tasks based on two key factors: urgency and importance.

## Features

- **Four Quadrants**: Organize tasks into Do First, Schedule, Delegate, and Eliminate
- **Task Management**: Add, edit, delete, and mark tasks as complete
- **Progress Tracking**: Monitor completion rates and task statistics
- **Multiple Views**: Switch between matrix and list layouts
- **Filter Options**: Show or hide completed tasks
- **Export Capabilities**: Download your tasks as JSON or CSV

## The Four Quadrants

### 1. Do First (Urgent & Important)
**Priority**: HIGHEST  
Critical tasks that require immediate attention. These are crises, deadlines, and emergencies that can't wait.

**Examples**: 
- Emergency meetings
- Critical bug fixes
- Urgent client requests
- Project deadlines

### 2. Schedule (Not Urgent but Important)
**Priority**: HIGH  
Strategic tasks that contribute to long-term goals. Plan and schedule these for dedicated time.

**Examples**:
- Strategic planning
- Relationship building
- Professional development
- Health and wellness activities

### 3. Delegate (Urgent but Not Important)
**Priority**: MEDIUM  
Tasks that need to be done soon but don't require your specific expertise. Delegate when possible.

**Examples**:
- Routine emails
- Some phone calls
- Administrative tasks
- Certain meetings

### 4. Eliminate (Not Urgent & Not Important)
**Priority**: LOW  
Time-wasters and distractions. Minimize or eliminate these activities.

**Examples**:
- Excessive social media
- Unnecessary meetings
- Busy work
- Interruptions

## How to Use
